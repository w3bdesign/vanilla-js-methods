Here's a basic implementation of the find() method in JavaScript:

```
function myFind(arr, callback) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (callback(arr[i], i, arr)) {
      return arr[i];
    }
  }
  return undefined;
}
```

The myFind() function takes two arguments: an array arr and a callback function. The callback function is called for each element in the arr array, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the current element satisfies a certain condition.

The callback function takes three arguments: the current element in the array (arr[i]), the index of the current element (i), and the original array (arr). The callback function can then check some condition on the current element and return true if the condition is satisfied.

The myFind() function returns the first element in the array for which the callback function returns true. If no such element is found, undefined is returned.

Note that this implementation stops iterating over the array as soon as the first matching element is found, just like the built-in find() method.
